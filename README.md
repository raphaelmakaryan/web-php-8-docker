# Simple PHP 8.1 Project for DevOps Training
## Introduction
Welcome to this simple PHP 8.1 project! This project serves as a support tool to help students understand the basics of deploying a PHP application in a production environment. This is a part of our DevOps training curriculum. It's a very straightforward project, built with educational purposes in mind.

## Prerequisites
1. PHP 8.1 or higher installed on your machine. You can download and install it from here.
2. Basic knowledge of terminal commands.
3. Text editor for code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.).
## Installation & Running Locally
### Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/WilliamBurillon/devops-training-php-8.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd YourRepoName
````

### Running the Project
To run the project locally, you will utilize PHP's built-in web server. The built-in server is sufficient for development and testing but should not be used in production.

Execute the following command to start the PHP built-in web server:

```
php -S localhost:8080
```
Once you run this command, the terminal should display a message like:

```
Listening on http://localhost:8080
```
Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the project running.
